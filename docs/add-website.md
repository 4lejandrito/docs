title: Add your website details
---

Once you have an account, you can enter the domain name of the website you want to track. Please, remove `https` and `www` from the URL, just keep the `hostname` (yourdomain.com).

For example, if your site is `https://www.yourdomain.com` then the part to enter in the “Domain” field is `yourdomain.com`.

If you would like to track a subdomain such as `blog.yourdomain.com` then please include the subdomain. Plausible Analytics essentially sees different subdomains as different sites.

For example, if your subdomain is `https://blog.yourdomain.com` then the part to enter in the “Domain” field is `blog.yourdomain.com`.

You need to select your reporting timezone too. This sets the day boundary of your reports regardless of where your traffic is coming from.

For instance, if you select “(GMT+01:00) Amsterdam…” then the beginning and the end of each day of your reporting is calculated based on the time in Amsterdam, even if your visitors come from London or New York.

The best practice is to set the timezone that reflects the location of your audience or if the audience is very broad and spread across the world to set the timezone of your location.
