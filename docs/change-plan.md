Next up, you will see your new charge that is due now. This is a pro-rated amount which reflects the amount you have paid on your previous subscription and the amount of time until that subscription was supposed to expire. 

You will also see the date of the next subscription renewal and the amount of that payment. Your subscription will be renewed automatically and you can change or cancel your plan at any time.

Click on the "**Confirm plan change**" to confirm the new subscription.
