* [WordPress](wordpress-integration.md): There's no official Plausible Analytics WordPress plugin right now but [here are two ways](wordpress-integration.md) you can insert the Plausible Analytics script into your site. There's also the "**[Unofficial Plausible Analytics Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/unofficial-plausible-analytics)**" built and maintained by Joe Clarke of [TaskBill.io](https://taskbill.io/).

* [Ghost](https://ghost.org/integrations/plausible/): Integrate Ghost with Plausible Analytics using a straightforward code injection.

* [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog): Integrate Micro.blog with Plausible Analytics using a plugin. You can add it under Find Plug-ins in Micro.blog and then use the Settings button to configure it for your Plausible Analytics account. Built and maintained by [Lukas Rosenstock](https://lukasrosenstock.net/2020/07/24/ive-struggled-a.html). Here's [the source code](https://github.com/LukasRos/plugin-plausible).
