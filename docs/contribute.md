Thank you for being interested in contributing to Plausible Analytics! We’re very happy that you want to help! Here are some of the ways you can help us build better Plausible:

1. Submitting new feature ideas through our [public roadmap](https://github.com/plausible/analytics/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22on+the+roadmap%22+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc). You can submit new feature ideas, you can comment to the existing feature requests, you can upvote features you’d like to see and you can subscribe to the particular feature to follow its progress.

2. Reporting bugs or issues or in any other way contributing to the development of the Plausible Analytics on [our GitHub](https://github.com/plausible/analytics/issues). Thanks to our GitHub contributors we were able to reduce our script size, develop the easy self-hosting solution and more.

3. Blogging, tweeting and in any other way sharing with the world what you like about Plausible Analytics, what you use it for and how it helps you solve your challenges.
