## Email reports

Here you can decide to enable weekly (every Monday) and/or monthly (every 1st of the month) reports to be sent directly into your email inbox. 

These email reports can be scheduled to be sent to multiple recipients. Enable the weekly or monthly report, add an individual recipient into the email field and click on the "Add recipient" button.

All the stats are embedded directly in the email and there's no need to go to the Plausible Analytics website to view them. There are no attachments, no PDFs and no links to click on in the email report either.
