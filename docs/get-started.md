## 1. Create your Plausible Analytics account

To use Plausible Analytics, you need to [register an account](https://plausible.io/register). To explore the product, we offer you a free 30-day trial. There are no restrictions on your usage during the free trial and no credit card is required to sign up.

Fill in your full name and your email address. We'll send you an email to verify your email address. Look for an email with the subject line "Activate your Plausible free trial". Click on the link within that email.

That will take you to the page where you have to set up your account password. You can proceed to the next step once you have set up your password.

## 2. Add your website details

Once you have an account, you can enter the domain name of the website you want to track. 

See [how to add your website details](add-website.md).

## 3. Add Plausible Analytics script to your website

On this step, we will display your Plausible Analytics tracking script code. 

See [how to add Plausible Analytics script to your website](plausible-script.md) for full instructions.

## 4. Verify that the integration is working

After you've added the Plausible Analytics script on your website, it's time to verify that the integration is working.
