title: Goal Conversions
--- 

Plausible Analytics gives you an option to specify and track goals. Goals are actions that you want your users to take, for example, visit a specific page URL, sign up to a newsletter, click on the "download" button, or complete the checkout form of an e-commerce store.

With this feature, youâ€™ll be able to track the number of goals completed, the number of conversion and other statistics including referrer sources that are driving conversions.

There are two types of goals in Plausible Analytics: [Pageview goals](pageview-goals.md) which allow you to measure how many people visit a specific page URL and [Custom event goals](custom-event-goals.md) which allow you to measure button clicks or form completions.
