Plausible Analytics is built with simplicity and speed in mind. There is no navigational menu. There are no additional sub-menus. There is no need to create custom reports. You get one simple and useful web analytics dashboard out of the box.

Rather than tracking every metric imaginable, many of them that you will never find a use for, Plausible Analytics focuses on the essential website stats only. It is easy to use and understand with no training or prior experience.

Hereâ€™s what you can discover on your Plausible Analytics dashboard:

* Choose the time range that you want to analyze. The visitor numbers are automatically presented on an hourly, daily, or monthly graph. The default time frame is set at the last 30 days.

* See the number of unique visitors, total page views, and the bounce rate (the percentage of sessions that had one page view only). These metrics include a percentage comparison to the previous time period, so you understand if the trends are going up or down.

* See all the referral sources of traffic and all the most visited pages on your site. Bounce rates of the individual referrals and pages are included too.

* See the list of countries your traffic is coming from. You can also see the device, browser, and operating system your visitors are using.

* Track events and goals to identify the number of converted visitors, the conversion rate, and the referral sites that send the best quality traffic.
