Plausible Analytics is built with simplicity and speed in mind. There is no navigational menu. There are no additional sub-menus. There is no need to create custom reports. You get one simple and useful web analytics dashboard out of the box.

Rather than tracking every metric imaginable, many of them that you will never find a use for, Plausible Analytics focuses on the essential website stats only. It is easy to use and understand with no training or prior experience.

Here’s what you can discover on your Plausible Analytics dashboard:

## Top Graph

* See the number of unique visitors, total page views, the bounce rate (the percentage of sessions that had one page view only) and the visit duration. These metrics include a percentage comparison to the previous time period, so you understand if the trends are going up or down.

* Choose the time range that you want to analyze in the date picker in the top right. The visitor numbers are automatically presented on an hourly, daily, or monthly graph. The default time frame is set at the last 30 days.

* By clicking on the number of "**current visitors**" or by selecting "**Realtime**" in the date picker in the top right, you can see the realtime dashboard that tells you what's happening on your site live in that moment. It also includes a pageview graph for the last 30 minutes. The realtime dashboard is live so you don’t have to refresh it to stay up to date.

## Top Sources

* See all the top referral sources of traffic ranked by the number of unique visitors. You can click on the "**details**" button to see the full list with additional details. Bounce rates and visit duration of the individual referrals are included too. You can click on any referral source to drill down into that source.

* You can also see all the traffic coming from the UTM tags. Click on the "**medium**", "**source**" and "**campaign**" tabs on your top sources report to explore these.

## Top Pages

* See all the most visited pages on your site ranked by the number of unique visitors. You can click on the "**details**" button to see the full list with additional details. The number of pageviews and the bounce rates of the individual pages are included too. You can click on any page to drill down into that page. 

* You can also see the traffic flow by looking at tne "**entry pages**" and "**exit pages**" reports. You can click on the "**details**" button to see the full list with additional details. For "**Entry pages**" details include visit duration for visits that started on a specific page and for "**Exit pages**" details include the exit rate percentage.

## Countries

* See the list of countries your traffic is coming from. 

## Devices

* You can also see the device, browser (including browser versions), and operating system (including OS versions) your visitors are using.

## Goal Conversions

* Track events and goals to identify the number of unique converted visitors, the total number of conversions, the conversion rate, and the referral sites that send the traffic that converts the best. You can even use custom properties to create your own metrics to collect and analyze data that Plausible doesn’t automatically track. 

You can go granular and click on any of the metrics on your Plausible dashboard to filter the dashboard by it. Drill down into mobile users, Chrome browser users or visitors from France and analyze your stats that way. You can mix and match filters too. For instance you can drill down to see traffic to a specific page from a specific referral source over time.
