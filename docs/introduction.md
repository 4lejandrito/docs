This is the documentation for [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io/), a simple, open-source, lightweight (< 1 KB) and privacy-friendly web analytics alternative to Google Analytics. 

While Plausible Analytics software is libre and open source, our cloud product is not free (as in beer) because our business model is subscriptions rather than mining the data of your visitors for advertising purposes. Subscription fees cover our costs and provide us a sustainable business model that allows Plausible Analytics to be 100% self-funded and independent.
