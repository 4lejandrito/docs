[Plausible Analytics Self-Hosted](https://plausible.io/blog/self-hosted-web-analytics-beta) is our free as in beer and free as in speech version of Plausible Analytics. Itâ€™s exactly the same product as our Plausible Analytics Cloud solution, only the self-hosted version you have to install, host and manage yourself.

To get started, follow the instructions in [our self-hosting documentation](https://github.com/plausible/analytics/blob/master/HOSTING.md).

Here are other Plausible Analytics Self-Hosted user guides:

* [Self hosting Plausible](https://theorangeone.net/posts/self-hosting-plausible/) by Jake Howard

* [How to self-host Plausible Analytics](https://www.garron.blog/posts/how-to-install-plausible-analytics.html) by Guillermo Garron

Let us know about any other self-hosted guides that you've published and we will feature them. Thanks for your support!
