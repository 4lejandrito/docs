title: Adding Plausible Analytics script to your website
---

Your Plausible Analytics tracking script code will look something like this:

<script async defer data-domain=”yourdomain.com” src=”https://plausible.io/js/plausible.js”></script>

To integrate your website with Plausible Analytics, you need to be able to update the HTML code of the website you want to track. Paste the tracking script code in the Header (`<head>`) section of your site. Place the tracking script between the `<head>….</head>` tags of your website.

After you've added your site details and added the Plausible Analytics script to the HTML of your website, you should see the script installed on your site. You can verify this by viewing the HTML of your website in the browser.

In your favorite web browser such as Firefox, visit your website, right-click anywhere on the page and choose “View Page Source”. Then press `cmd+f` for Mac or `ctrl+f` for Linux and Windows to search and type `plausible`.

If you followed the previous steps correctly, you should see our tracking code in the source code.
