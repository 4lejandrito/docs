## 3. Add Plausible Analytics script to your website

On this step, we will display your Plausible Analytics tracking script code. The code will look something like this:

<script async defer data-domain=”yourdomain.com” src=”https://plausible.io/js/plausible.js”></script>

To integrate your website with Plausible Analytics, you need to be able to update the HTML code of the website you want to track. Paste the tracking script code in the Header (`<head>`) section of your site. Place the tracking script between the `<head>….</head>` tags of your website.

After you've added your site details and added the Plausible Analytics script to the HTML of your website, you should see the script installed on your site. You can verify this by viewing the HTML of your website in the browser.

In your favorite web browser such as Firefox, visit your website, right-click anywhere on the page and choose “View Page Source”. Then press `cmd+f` for Mac or `ctrl+f` for Linux and Windows to search and type `plausible`.

If you followed the previous steps correctly, you should see our tracking code in the source code.

## 4. Verify that the integration is working

After you've added the Plausible Analytics script on your website, it's time to verify that the integration is working.

In your Plausible Analytics account, click on your website domain name. You should see a blinking green dot which indicates that we’re listening for incoming page views in real-time. 

Once the first page view comes through, you'll be automatically taken to the stats page. This is an indication that the integration is working, congrats!

If you didn't see the green blinking dot, there's nothing to worry about. It just means that someone visited your site already since you installed the Plausible Analytics script. 

If you see the dashboard with graphs and numbers, it means everything is working! Plausible Analytics is now tracking your website statistics while preserving the privacy of your visitors.
