To use Plausible Analytics, you need to [register an account](https://plausible.io/register). To explore the product, we offer you a free 30-day trial. There are no restrictions on your usage during the free trial and no credit card is required to sign up.

Fill in your full name and your email address. We'll send you an email to verify your email address. Look for an email with the subject line "Activate your Plausible free trial". Click on the link within that email.

That will take you to the page where you have to set up your account password. You can proceed to the next step once you have set up your password.
