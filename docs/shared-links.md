title: Shared links
---

Within the "Shared links" section of your website settings you can share your stats privately by generating a shared link. Click on the "+ new link" button to do so. 

This link is impossible to guess but you can add password protection for extra security on the following screen. 

Or if you prefer to share using the secure link without the password protection you can keep the password field blank. Then click the "Create shared link" button and your new shared link will be displayed.

You can click on the trash can icon if you want to remove the particular shared link.
