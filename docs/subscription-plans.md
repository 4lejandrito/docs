Plausible gives you great control and flexibility in plans you can subscribe to, the billing frequency and in upgrading or downgrading your subscription tier. Here's how to choose the subscription tier that's right for you.

## All plans are priced according to your traffic levels

All Plausible Analytics subscription plans are priced according to your monthly traffic levels.

To get your traffic level, we take all the websites you have added to your Plausible account and total the number of page views between them. If you use the "[Custom Events](custom-event-goals.md)" feature, then these count towards your total monthly pageviews too.

The "Custom Events" include any custom goals, custom properties and goals such as external link click tracking and 404 error page tracking. "[Pageview goals](pageview-goals.md)" are not counted towards your usage.

You can check your usage number in your account settings within the "Subscription Plan" section under the heading "Your usage". This is your page views usage and you should get on a subscription plan that fits these traffic levels.

Our lowest subscription tier is up to 10,000 pageviews per month and it is priced at $6/month if you pay monthly.

There's a 33% discount on all plans for those that want to pay annually. The annual billing discount makes our lowest tier $48 for the full year or $4 per month.

You can see all of [our subscription plans and pricing](https://plausible.io/#pricing) on our website or within your Plausible account.

## What happens if I go over my monthly page views limit?

You will never be charged extra for an occasional traffic spike. We will never stop counting your stats because of an occasional traffic spike either. There are no surprise fees and your card will never be charged unexpectedly. 

Suppose new higher traffic levels become your new standard and your page views exceed your subscription plan for two consecutive months. In that case, you can upgrade your subscription to a more appropriate tier for the following month using our self-serve platform.

If you don't do that, we will contact you to remind you to upgrade to a higher plan as well. After we contact you, you will have two weeks to make a decision. You can decide to continue with a higher plan or to cancel your account at that point.

## Features that are available on every plan

There are no differences in terms of features available on the different subscription plans. All the features are available on every plan. 

There are no restrictions in features and no data retention limits either. You can add an unlimited number of websites to the same Plausible account too.

Same works for our 30-day free trial. There are no restrictions on features or usage limits within the trial month either.
 
## How do I manage my subscription?

Everything is self-serve within your account settings. There are no long term contracts and you can change your subscription tier or cancel your plan at any time. You do not need to call or contact us.
