Plausible allows you to invite your team members to view the stats and manage sites you have added to your Plausible account. Here's how.

### How to invite users

Go into [the site settings](website-settings.md) of the website you'd like to invite users to.

Click on the "**People**" section on the left-hand sidebar.

Click on the "**Invite**" button.

Enter the email address of the person you'd like to invite. 

* You can invite any email address. It doesn't necessarily need to be an email address from your company. 
* You can invite existing Plausible users and invite people who don't have a Plausible account. 
* If you invite a new person to Plausible, they will get an email and need to register for a Plausible account. 
* Viewers and admins do not need to have a Plausible subscription. As long as they are not the owner of any site added to Plausible, they can continue accessing stats with a free account

Assign the role for the invited user. You can choose between two different roles:

* "**Admin**" gets access to the stats dashboard and can also change the site settings
* "**Viewer**" gets access to the stats dashboard

Click on the "**Invite**" button. We will send an email to the invited person to notify them about your invitation. They will need to register for a Plausible account (or log in to their existing Plausible account) and accept your invitation.

### How to modify the user roles

You can change the user role at any time:

* Go into the site settings of the website you'd like to modify the roles for
* Click on the "**People**" section on the left-hand sidebar. That's where you can get an overview of the current team members and their existing roles
* Click on the current role next to the name of the person you'd like to change the role for
* Choose a new role for the user

That's it. The user now has a different role.

Note that you need to be an owner or an admin of a site in order to change user roles.

### How to remove a user

You can remove a user from having access to a site at any time:

* Go into the site settings of the website you'd like to remove a user for
* Click on the "**People**" section on the left-hand sidebar
* Click on the current role next to the name of the person you'd like to remove
* Click "**Remove member**" 

That's it. The user has now been removed from the specific site.

Note that you need to be an owner or an admin of a site in order to remove users.
