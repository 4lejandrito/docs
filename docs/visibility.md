title: Visibility
---

Within the "Visibility" section of your website settings you can choose to be transparent and make your website stats public so anyone with your custom link can view them.

Your website stats are private by default. Making them public will give you access to your public stats URL so you can share it with the world. Some website owners link to their public stats from their footer, or their "About" page. It is really up to you.

If you wish to make your website stats private again, click on the "Make stats private" button.
