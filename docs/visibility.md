## Visibility

Your website stats are private by default but you can choose to be transparent and make them public so anyone with your custom link can view them. Click on the "Make stats public" to do so. This will then display your public stats URL so you can share it. Some website owners link to their public stats from their footer, or their "About" page. It is really up to you.

If you wish to make your website stats private again, click on the "Make stats private" button.
