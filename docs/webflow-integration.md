title: How to add the script to your Webflow site

import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

You can use the "**[Custom Code](https://university.webflow.com/lesson/custom-code-in-the-head-and-body-tags)**" feature to add Plausible Analytics tracking code to your Webflow website same way you would add Google Analytics code or any other JavaScript code. Site-wide JavaScript code injection is a premium Webflow feature so you need to upgrade your Webflow account to a paid subscription plan.

* In your "**Project settings**" click on "**Custom code**".

* Find the "**Head code**" section.

* Paste your Plausible tracking code in the "**Head code**" section and save changes.

Now you can go to your website to [verify if the Plausible Analytics script has been added](plausible-script.md#verify-if-the-script-is-installed-on-your-site) and to your Plausible Analytics account to see [whether the stats are being tracked](verify-integration.md).
