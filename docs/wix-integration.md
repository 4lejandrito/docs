title: How to add the script to your Wix site

import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

You can use the "**[Tracking Tools](https://support.wix.com/en/article/embedding-custom-code-to-your-site)**" feature to add Plausible Analytics tracking code to your Wix website same way you would add Google Analytics code or any other JavaScript code. Site-wide JavaScript code injection is a premium Wix feature so you need to upgrade your Wix account to a paid subscription plan.

* In your site's dashboard, click on "**Settings**", and in "**Tracking Tools**" click on "**Manage**".

* Click on the "**+ New Tool**" button and select "**Custom**".

* Paste your Plausible tracking code, choose which pages to add the code to ("**All Pages**"), select to "**Load code once**" ([read more about this here](https://support.wix.com/en/article/custom-code-loading-options)), select "**Head**" as the place for the code and click on the "**Apply**" button.

Now you can go to your website to [verify if the Plausible Analytics script has been added](plausible-script.md#verify-if-the-script-is-installed-on-your-site) and to your Plausible Analytics account to see [whether the stats are being tracked](verify-integration.md).
